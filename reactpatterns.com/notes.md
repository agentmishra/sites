## BIG QUESTIONS?
- typescript?
- reactishard.com
    - `class/className`
- Open-closed, Single Reponsiblity
  - solidreact.com
- standardize on `rest` vs `restProps`
  - a coloquial name? `allOfTheRestOfTheDOMProps`

## react basics
- component
- expressions
- props
- (defaultProps) replaced defalut values when destructuring
- Destructuring props (maybe JS for React)

## JSX spread attributes
- GOTTA GET OUT OF GREET COMPONENT HELL
- non-DOM props are important to cover


## Merge destructured props with other values
- alt title idea: Extend components with additional props (Michelle C. Funk)
- Good abstractions allow for extension. (link to SOLID)
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle
  - reactiscard class/className link/
  - can it be broken down?
  - more output demonstrations
  - this vs that examples / before vs after
  - 

## Container Components
- have note about how this fallen out of fashion
- link to preferred alternatives
  - Hooks
